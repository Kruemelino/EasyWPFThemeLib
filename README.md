# EasyWPFThemeLib
 
This library is used in my Outlook add-in [Fritz!Box Telefon-Dingsbums](https://github.com/Kruemelino/FritzBoxTelefon-dingsbums). 
It is based on the existing work by AngryCarrot789: [WPFDarkTheme](https://github.com/AngryCarrot789/WPFDarkTheme). 
However, extensive revisions and additions have been made:
* Theme colors have been replaced. (see: [Telerik: VisualStudio2013 Theme](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/wpf/styling-and-appearance/themes-suite/visualstudio2013))
* The number of colors has been reduced.
* The definitions of the controls have been unified.
* Deactivated elements are displayed in the same way.

Nevertheless, this is a working status. Many controls still need to be revised.
